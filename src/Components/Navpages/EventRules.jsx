            <strong>1.</strong> Respect goes both ways! We will never push
            anyone to handle an animal if they are uncomfortable, and if one of
            the animals becomes too stressed we will stop that interaction and
            resume display only.

            <strong>2.</strong> In order to prevent injury to the animals,
            children must be seated or in one place while handling. No running
            or taking the animals to a different location. We reserve the right
            to return the animals to the bins for any reason. We donâ€™t need any
            pythons on the run!

            <strong>3.</strong> Everyone is welcome to spend time with the
            animals, but children 4 and under must pet the tops to reduce risk
            of drops/squeezing. The animals require steady touch and control
            while handling.

            There may be changes to the reservation due to inclement weather. If
            temperatures go below 60 degrees Fahrenheit, events must be held
            indoors for the safety of the animals.
